  [root@ip-172-31-7-5 k8s-specifications]# kubectl delete pod db-b54cd94f4-j4f8s
  pod "db-b54cd94f4-j4f8s" deleted
  
  Result :
    New db pod created and older one terminated. Worker pod restarted. But all pods are working fine.
    
    NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    db-b54cd94f4-g97zk        1/1     Running   0          19h
    redis-868d64d78-g99js     1/1     Running   0          20h
    result-5d57b59f4b-l2vcx   1/1     Running   0          20h
